# Test Diagrams

## Testing the corrected diagrams

### 1. Car Rental Swimlane Diagram
File: `car_booking_swimlane.puml`

**Changes made:**
- Replaced `note right of |Swimlane|` with `legend right`
- Used table in legend to display information
- Added colors for different sections
- Updated terminology from "booking" to "rental"

**How to test:**
1. Copy content from `car_booking_swimlane.puml`
2. Paste into [PlantUML Online Server](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/)
3. Check for syntax errors

### 2. Car Rental Cancellation Swimlane Diagram
File: `car_booking_cancellation_swimlane.puml`

**Changes made:**
- Similar to main diagram
- Used legend instead of notes
- Updated terminology from "booking" to "rental"

### 3. Car Rental System Overview
File: `car_booking_system_overview.puml`

**Status:** Updated terminology from "booking" to "rental" where appropriate

## Fixed Issues

### Syntax Error in Activity Diagram
**Problem:** In PlantUML activity diagram, cannot use `note right of |Swimlane|` at the end of diagram.

**Solution:** 
- Use `legend right` instead
- Create table in legend with colors
- Keep all information but display in different format

### Legend Structure
```plantuml
legend right
|= |= |
|<#lightblue>|**Title 1:**|
| |Content 1|
| |Content 2|
|<#lightgreen>|**Title 2:**|
| |Content 3|
| |Content 4|
endlegend
```

## Expected Results

After fixing, the diagrams will:
1. Have no syntax errors
2. Display complete information
3. Have color-coded sections
4. Be easy to read and understand
5. Use consistent "rental" terminology

## How to Use

1. **Online:** Use PlantUML Online Server
2. **VS Code:** Install PlantUML extension
3. **Command line:** Use PlantUML jar file

## Notes

- These diagrams describe the actual workflow of the Drivon car rental system
- Based on real code from controllers
- Can be updated when system changes
- Uses "rental" terminology consistently throughout
